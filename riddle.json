   "Question": "I expect Richard will nevermore\r\nstart any degree of pointless war.\r\nI, however, stay above, full circle in the sky.\r\nA moment spectacle, from when the clouds cry.",
   "Answer": "\n\nAnswer\nRainbow.\n\r\n'Richard of York Gave Battle In Vain' is the mnemonic the first two lines are based on. This mnemonic is from the acronym ROYGBIV, which stands for Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, and Violet, the colours of the rainbow.\n\r\nA rainbow is a full circle, half of which is hidden beneath the Earth when it is in the sky.\n\r\nA rainbow is caused by the refraction of light when it rains.\n"
