                <h3>Why Cracking Code?</h3>
                <p>For any college student who has not been coding for years upon years, coding interviews can be extremely intimidating. </p>

                <p><em>What if I can't solve the question? How do I even begin to approach this problem? There is no way that I'm writing this code correctly. I've learned so many data structures and algorithms, but which ones do I choose?</em></p>

                <p>These are all thoughts that go through most interviewees minds at some point. For that reason, Cracking Code hopes to ease your minds and help you feel more prepared during the interview by pushing you think outside the box on brain teasers and other algorithm-based questions presented on this site. <br><br>Secondly, coding is <strong>not</strong> something that can be learned overnight, but rather a skill crafted with years of practice. Our goal is for you as a coder to be exposed to as many questions encompassing a wide variety of computer-science topics so that you have more confidence and tools at your disposal when you are in the room interviewing for that coveted internship or job. <em><strong>Enjoy!</strong></em></p>

                    <p id = "BTANS"><strong><em>Answer: 350 km.</em></strong> Most people will immediately answer 5000 miles, simply multiplying the number of bikes with their total capacity. However, the bikes are not staggered 100 miles apart conveniently for you to ride one bike to capacity just to find the next one. Therefore, we can move all bikes by 50 miles, then take the fuel from half the bikes and refill the other half. This would leave us with 25 bikes with full fuel tanks and a total distance covered of 50 miles. If we continue this process, we are left with 12 bikes and 100 miles covered, then 6 bikes and 150 miles covered, then 3 bikes and 200 miles covered, then 1 bike and 250 mile covered. Now, since we are left with 1 bike with a full fuel tank, we can ride it for the last 100 miles, giving us a maximum distance of 350 miles. Clever, right? </p>

                    <p id = "BTANS"><strong><em>Answer:</em></strong> Whenever you see an interview question regarding linked lists, you should think of the runner technique. The runner technique is where you use 2 pointers and have one of those pointers traverse through the linked list at a different rate than the other. For this question, let's initialize 2 pointers: slow and fast, both set to the head pointer to start. Then we want to continuously iterate, moving slow by 1 spot (slow = slow->next) and moving fast by 2 spots (fast = fast->next->next). If fast reaches the end of the linked list, or a nullptr, then we know there is no cycle and can return false. However, if there is a cycle, fast and slow will get caught in a loop, and since fast moves at twice the pace as slow, fast will eventually be at the same node as slow. Therefore, if fast ever equals slow, we know there is a cycle and can return true. This solution requires O(n) time and O(1) space.<br><br>Another approach to this problem would to use an unordered_set of Node* objects. As we traverse through the linked list, we can add every Node* to our set and if the node that we are at is already in the set, we know that that there is a cycle and return true. If we reach a nullptr, then we know there is no cycle and can return false. This solution is done in O(n) time and O(n) space. Cool!</p>
