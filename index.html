                <h1> Cracking Code</h1>
                <h3><em>Pushing you to solve problems with an algorithmic mindset</em></h3>
                Welcome to Cracking Code! This will serve as your one-stop shop for all things computer science interview related. Our purpose is to help you to understand and apply the knowledge you have gained in the classroom to real-world problems. <strong><em>Computer science is the future and we want you to get ahead of the curve!</em></strong></p>
                
                <h3>Why Code Crackers?</h3>
                <p>For any college student who has not been coding for years upon years like some of their peers, coding interviews can be extremely intimidating. </p>
                
                <p><em>What if I can't solve the question? How do I even begin to approach this problem? There is no way that I'm writing this code correctly. I've learned so many data structures and algorithms, but which ones do I choose?</em></p>
    
                <p>These are all thoughts that go through most interviewees minds at some point. For that reason, Code Cracker hopes to ease your minds and help you feel more prepared during the interview by pushing you think outside the box on brain teasers and other algorithm-based questions presented on this site. Enjoy!</p>
